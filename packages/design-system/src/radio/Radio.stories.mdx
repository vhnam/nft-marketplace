# Radio

Radio buttons allow users to choose a single value from a range of options.

Best practices

- When a user picks an option, the previous one is automatically deselected.
- Radio buttons should be used when there is at least two options.
- Label of the Radio button should be concise and straightforward.
- Use the Checkbox component if the user could select one or several values.
- Start all Radio button labels with a capital letter.
- There is no need to include Radio buttons in a Select component when only a single value can be selected.
- Radio buttons should be used sparingly in the interface.
- Radio buttons should be used only when it is not obvious enough that a choice is required.
- Radio buttons should not be used in Table components.
- Use Switch or Toggle component to make binary choices.
