# Button

Buttons are a way to perform actions within a page. They help interact with its content via a single click. According to their style, specific labels and icons, they help understand the most important actions to take.

Best practices

- A button should have a relevant and clear label.
- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.
- If there are no primary action on a screen yet, this might be the one to look for.
- Prefer to have not more than two buttons side to side.
- To navigate to another page in your browser (use Link component instead).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Variants">
    <Button variant="neutral">Neutral</Button>
    <Button variant="tertiary">Tertiary</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button Sizes

Main actions usually use a `medium` button (top of a screen, footer of a modal, ...). For subsidiary action, a `small` button suits more (filters, configure the view, ...).

Use the size prop to change the size of the button. You can set the value to `x-small`, `small` or `medium`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sizes">
    <Button size="x-small">X-Small</Button>
    <Button size="small">Small</Button>
    <Button size="medium">Medium</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button with Icons

A button can be associated with an icon to give more impact.

You can add start and end icons to the Button component using the `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` props respectively.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Icons">
    <Button leftIcon={<BiInfoCircle />}>Icon Button</Button>
    <Button rightIcon={<BiInfoCircle />}>Icon Button</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button disabled

All action that cannot be performed yet.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Disabled">
    <Button variant="neutral" disabled>
      Neutral
    </Button>
    <Button variant="tertiary" disabled>
      Tertiary
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Full width button

All action that cannot be performed yet.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Fullwidth">

  </Story>
</Canvas>
